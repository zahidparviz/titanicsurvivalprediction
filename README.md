# Notebook Name

This repository is about a Colab notebook in which I have trained, tested and validated data for Titanic Survival Prediction.

## Overview

In the code, there will be a trained model, which will predict whether the specific person represented by his/her ID will survive or not in Titanic incident.

## Table of Contents

Main sections:

- [Section 1: Data Preprocessing](section1.ipynb)
- [Section 2: Exploratory Data Analysis](section2.ipynb)
- [Section 3: Model Training](section3.ipynb)

## Installation

You need to install some libraries and packages to work with this notebook. The packages are described at the start of notebook.

## Usage

You can copy the code in this notebook and paste in your own project or you can download this code directly from here and run in your environment.

## Results
